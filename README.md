# vue-base

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. Also I have added:

- Vue Router
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- Pinia

For this project, I have created a basic web application that displays every global flag and incorporates a basic search bar for filtering by country name.
